# Experiments-with-Radiation-Function-in-Genetic-Algorithms
The goal of this research is to look at adding a "radiation" function to GAs, which is comparable to the way exposure to ionizing radiation in living organisms, changes their causing mutations in them. The "radiation" when a GA is trapped on a local optima will result in fluxes in the crossover and mutation rates.
